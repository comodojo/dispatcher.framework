<p>A long December, and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin'
Now the days go by so fast.
</p><p>
And it's one more day up in the canyon
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven...
I wish you would.
